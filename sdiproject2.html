<p>My weight loss is a life change.  I say this because I had to change how I think about food, how I think about exercise, and must never go back to my old way of thinking.  It was never just going on a diet, because “diets” end, and staying fit, can never.   </p>
<p>So my new life style begins minutes after my feet hit the floor in the morning.   I take a Men’s one-A-day multi vitamin, each and everyday. There are a lot of vitamins per bottle so it does last a long time, but from now on, that is something I will replenish every time the last vitamin in that bottle is take.  </p>

<p>When it comes to working, esp. for a beginner, I had to start of with the tools I had.  Not having a lot of money to spend on exercise equipment, means I needed to improvise.  Since my Fiancée  already had Jillian Michael’s Last chance Workout DVD, and JM’s 6 week to six pack, I started there.  The Last Chance workout DVD, I used for my upper body, 6 Week to 6 pack DVD was for my core, and I run for my lower body.

<p>I am lucky to live a condo complex with Meredyth, because we have access to a tiny gym.  A few free weights, a bench, one machine, and 3 treadmills, and a mirror wall straight out of the 70’s, is all that takes up the small room they call a gym. During the summer, I run outside, bike outside, and fallow along to Jillian’s DVD I our living room. I rarly go to the gym during the summer.  During the cold winter months, I feel stuck in the gym, so when it’s not cold, I stay out. </p>

<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>1201</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
