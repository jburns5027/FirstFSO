<p>My weight loss is a life change.  I say this because I had to change how I think about food, how I think about exercise, and must never go back to my old way of thinking.  It was never just going on a diet, because “diets” end, and staying fit, can never.   </p>
<p>So my new life style begins minutes after my feet hit the floor in the morning.   I take a Men’s one-A-day multi vitamin, each and everyday. There are a lot of vitamins per bottle so it does last a long time, but from now on, that is something I will replenish every time the last vitamin in that bottle is take.  </p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>1201</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
