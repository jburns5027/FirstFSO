<p>My weight loss is a life change.  I say this because I had to change how I think about food, how I think about exercise, and must never go back to my old way of thinking.  It was never just going on a diet, because “diets” end, and staying fit, can never.   </p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>1201</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
