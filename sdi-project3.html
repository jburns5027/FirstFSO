<p>My story is called "A winter day, running inside". I enjoy tracking my runs, and to do so is a process.  So I wanted to break down that process into a short story.</p>
<p>           It’s a bit of a process to run indoor on a treadmill, and mixing technology into that run. It’s very motivational for me to log my miles on nikerunning.com,and see how far I’ve come. </p>

<p>I also like to use a training app, called c25k.  It’s a nine-week program, that helps me not to over do my running, and train properly.  I’ve pretty much have it down to a routine. 
<p>First- open the nike GPS app, and choose ‘New Workout”, next choose location such as ‘indoors(treadmill), and tap “Start Workout”.  You’ll here the woman propt you that the workout has begun</p>
<p>Second- minimize the Nike app, and open the c25k app.  This time, you have to choose the appropriate day, of the appropriate week you are on, and tap “Begin Workout”, and also listen to the prompt.</p>
<p>I use the 5 min warm-up time to walk to the gym, so that when I get there, I can immediately start running.  In the morning, this saves time.</p>
