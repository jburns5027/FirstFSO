<p>This week was especially difficult for me.  Having to create librarys of javascript functions.  I understand why this is done, and like the idea of having a library to go to for functions that we will be using over and over again. Not grasping this months work, made this difficult for me, for that I felt many times that I needed to go back to week 1 to relearn the work.  This would have extended the 8hrs recommended to complete this assignment to 3 weeks.  I have submitted a review so to speak of this past 4 weeks. </p>
